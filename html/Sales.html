Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009
In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers 
to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] 
Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.<br>
That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, 
but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, <br>
Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
